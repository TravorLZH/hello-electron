hello-electron
=======

This is my first NodeJS repository with **ElectronJS** technology, so it is a desktop application written in HTML and JavaScript. This is more efficient than the legacy way (Using C/C++ to develop with a specific toolkit).

## Building

You need to have NodeJS and Git installed before execute the following commands

```
$ git clone https://github.com/TravorLZH/hello-electron.git
$ npm install
$ npm start             # Run the program
$ npm run package-win   # Build the binaries
```
